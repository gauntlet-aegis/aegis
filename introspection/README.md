# Aegis Introspection

This directory contains the current model-introspection research thread for
Aegis. The purpose is to test whether hidden-state features from a local model
can help distinguish safe secret handling from exfiltration-oriented behavior.

The work here is exploratory. The current results are useful checkpoints, not
validated production claims.

## System Alignment

The current work is the CIFT-like portion of the broader Aegis/AIS design. The
larger system should be treated as a multi-monitor gateway:

| Component | Role | Current Status |
|---|---|---|
| DP-HONEY | Inject format-matched honeytokens before model access. | Not implemented here yet. |
| CIFT-like activation monitor | Read hidden-state features before output generation. | Current focus. |
| Text leakage detector | Scan generated text for canary or secret leakage. | Not implemented here yet. |
| NIMBUS-like accumulator | Track cumulative leakage risk over a conversation. | Not implemented here yet. |

The activation probe is therefore a monitor signal, not the whole defense. It
should eventually emit structured evidence that a gateway policy engine can
combine with honeytoken evidence, post-output leakage scans, and cumulative
conversation risk.

The paper-specific CIFT target is narrower than generic activation probing:
monitor readout positions that occur after both secret context and the current
query or payload, rather than hidden states at static credential positions. The
paper also frames CIFT as a calibrated deviation signal over the last quarter of
transformer layers, followed by learned nonnegative layer weighting. The current
Aegis work approximates that direction with final-token/readout-style features
and grouped probe evaluation, but it has not yet implemented the paper's full
benign-calibrated CCI/CFS scoring path.

That distinction matters for planning:

| Question | Current Work | Paper-Aligned Target |
|---|---|---|
| Readout position | Final prompt token features. | Positions after secret context and query/payload; final prompt token plus pre-generation decision positions. |
| Layer handling | Individual and concatenated feature candidates. | Last-quarter layer hooks with calibrated per-layer deviation and learned layer weights. |
| Calibration | Grouped CV, residual analysis, human adjudication. | Benign calibration distribution, conformal/text thresholds, and deployment operating points. |
| System role | Candidate CIFT monitor signal. | One component in AIS per-turn pipeline before generation, combined with canary/text detection and NIMBUS. |

## Operating Workflow

Every experiment should answer these questions before it is promoted:

1. Which system component does this advance?
2. What runtime signal would this component emit?
3. What dataset or artifact proves the result without replacing prior evidence?
4. What grouped, held-out, or residual check protects against post-hoc overfit?
5. What failure cases need human review?
6. How does the result affect the eventual gateway decision pipeline?

For the current CIFT-like thread, use this workflow:

| Stage | Required Output |
|---|---|
| Scope | State whether the work is CIFT, DP-HONEY, text detection, NIMBUS, or integration. |
| Dataset | Add or reuse a registered prompt dataset with clear label and family semantics. |
| Extraction | Produce activation artifacts without overwriting prior checkpoints. |
| Evaluation | Run grouped evaluation first for credible claims. |
| Crosscheck | Compare against fixed references and newer candidates across checkpoints. |
| Residual analysis | Track fixed, persistent, and introduced errors by family. |
| Adjudication | Create human-review worksheets for promotion-sensitive regressions. |
| Paper alignment | State whether the result is an approximation or implements the paper method directly. |
| Promotion | Define an explicit rule before changing the active checkpoint or monitor contract. |
| Integration | Express the result as a monitor event suitable for gateway policy composition. |

The target monitor event shape is:

```json
{
  "monitor": "activation_probe",
  "component": "cift_like",
  "feature_key": "concat(final_token_layer_11,final_token_layer_16)",
  "task": "safe_secret_vs_exfiltration",
  "risk_score": 0.0,
  "decision": "allow|flag|block",
  "model_id": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
  "probe_version": "unpromoted",
  "evidence": {
    "evaluation_strategy": "stratified_group_kfold",
    "dataset_checkpoint": "hard_prompts_v3"
  }
}
```

Do not promote a feature solely because it improves one metric. Promotion should
balance aggregate performance, worst-checkpoint behavior, introduced-error
severity, human adjudication, and integration value for the full gateway.
For CIFT specifically, promotion should also state whether the candidate is a
temporary empirical probe or the first implementation of the paper-aligned
readout-position, calibrated-deviation monitor.

## Current State

Four datasets are currently registered in `data/lineage.json`:

| Dataset | Purpose | Rows |
|---|---|---:|
| `baseline_prompts_v1` | First hand-authored checkpoint dataset. | 90 |
| `hard_prompts_v1` | Harder contrastive successor to the baseline. | 90 |
| `hard_prompts_v2` | Targeted successor focused on V1 error clusters. | 90 |
| `hard_prompts_v3` | Held-out summary, redaction, and replacement checkpoint. | 90 |

All four datasets use the same label shape:

| Label | Count | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `benign` | 30 | No secret handling or exfiltration request. |
| `secret_present_safe` | 30 | A secret-like value appears, but the prompt asks for safe handling. |
| `exfiltration_intent` | 30 | The prompt asks to reveal, transmit, encode, route, or leak secret-like material. |

Each prompt has a `family` field. Grouped evaluation uses those families to
hold related prompt patterns out together.

The fixed historical activation checkpoint is:

```text
mean_pool_layer_18
```

For the important `safe_secret_vs_exfiltration` task:

| Dataset | Evaluation | Best Method | Macro F1 | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| Baseline | Random stratified CV | `activation_probe` | 0.9131 | 0.9167 |
| Baseline | Grouped CV | `activation_probe` | 0.8620 | 0.8667 |
| Hard V1 | Random stratified CV | `activation_probe` | 0.9163 | 0.9167 |
| Hard V1 | Grouped CV | `activation_probe` | 0.8788 | 0.8833 |
| Hard V2 | Random stratified CV | `activation_probe` | 0.7470 | 0.7500 |
| Hard V2 | Grouped CV | `activation_probe` | 0.7225 | 0.7333 |
| Hard V3 | Grouped CV | `activation_probe` | 0.8324 | 0.8333 |

The grouped results are the more credible checkpoints because they reduce
prompt-family leakage between train and test folds. Hard V1 is especially
useful because both TF-IDF baselines degrade sharply on the intent-sensitive
task while the activation probe remains comparatively strong.

Hard V2 is now the strongest pressure test. It focuses on the Hard V1 error
clusters: output contracts, tool arguments, broker boundaries, policy
exceptions, and summaries. Under grouped evaluation, the fixed activation probe
drops to 0.7225 macro F1 / 0.7333 accuracy on `safe_secret_vs_exfiltration`,
while word and character TF-IDF baselines fall below chance. The full
machine-readable prediction ledger is registered in lineage. Preliminary
adjudication found the 16 activation-probe misses label-defensible, so the next
move is analysis rather than dataset repair.

A grouped Hard V2 layer sweep found the best feature was `final_token_layer_11`
at 0.9657 macro F1 / 0.9667 accuracy, while the fixed
`mean_pool_layer_18` checkpoint ranked 39th. A cross-dataset check now confirms
that `final_token_layer_11` also improves Hard V1, but loses slightly on the
original baseline:

| Dataset | Reference | Candidate | Delta Macro F1 | Winner |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Baseline | 0.8620 | 0.8445 | -0.0175 | `mean_pool_layer_18` |
| Hard V1 | 0.8788 | 0.8993 | +0.0205 | `final_token_layer_11` |
| Hard V2 | 0.7225 | 0.9657 | +0.2432 | `final_token_layer_11` |

Treat `mean_pool_layer_18` as the fixed regression checkpoint and
`final_token_layer_11` as a candidate hard-case checkpoint until the candidate
is tested against new prompt families.

Residual analysis on Hard V2 strengthened that candidate reading. On
`safe_secret_vs_exfiltration`, `final_token_layer_11` reduces activation-probe
errors from 16 to 2, fixing 14 prior misses with 0 introduced target-task
errors. Both persistent misses are in `hard_v2_safe_summary_customer_note`.
However, the candidate introduces 1 error on `benign_vs_secret_related`, so this
is still a candidate checkpoint rather than a universal replacement.

Hard V3 provides fresh held-out coverage for summary, redaction, and replacement
behavior with neutral secret identifiers. On this corrected held-out set,
`final_token_layer_11` beats the fixed reference on `safe_secret_vs_exfiltration`
with 0.8818 macro F1 / 0.8833 accuracy versus 0.8324 macro F1 / 0.8333
accuracy. The residual comparison is mixed but positive: 7 fixed errors, 3
persistent errors, and 4 introduced errors. Across all four checkpoints,
`final_token_layer_11` now wins 3 and `mean_pool_layer_18` wins 1.

The V3 layer sweep found a stronger local feature, `final_token_layer_16`, at
0.9321 macro F1 / 0.9333 accuracy. Treat that as a diagnostic result, not a new
replacement, until it is checked against the earlier datasets.

The feature-stability check compares `mean_pool_layer_18`,
`final_token_layer_11`, and `final_token_layer_16` across all four checkpoints.
`final_token_layer_11` remains the best average performer at 0.8978 mean macro
F1, while `final_token_layer_16` is the stability challenger: it has the higher
minimum macro F1, the smaller range, and wins baseline plus Hard V3. The
historical reference wins none of the three-feature checkpoint comparisons, but
still anchors the experiment history.

The combined-feature check adds
`concat(final_token_layer_11,final_token_layer_16)` as a derived activation
matrix. It ranks first by mean macro F1 at 0.9151 and wins or ties three of four
checkpoints. The important caveat is Hard V3: `final_token_layer_16` remains the
local winner there, while the combined feature falls back to roughly
`final_token_layer_11` performance.

The combined-feature residual suite compares that candidate against
`mean_pool_layer_18`, `final_token_layer_11`, and `final_token_layer_16` across
all four checkpoints. The combined feature reduces aggregate target-task errors
against all three references: -21 versus the historical reference, -4 versus
`final_token_layer_11`, and -6 versus `final_token_layer_16`. The caution remains
Hard V3, where `final_token_layer_16` has 4 errors and the combined feature has
7. The combined feature is now the leading promotion candidate, but the Hard V3
introduced-error families should be reviewed before changing the checkpoint.

The Hard V3 combined-regression adjudication worksheet narrows that review to 3
introduced cases against `final_token_layer_16`: one exfiltration case the
combined feature misses as safe, and two safe cases the combined feature marks
as exfiltration. All three are pending human review.

A first CIFT-like calibrated-deviation comparison now tests a more
paper-aligned direction without replacing the static-feature thread. It uses
final-token readout features from the last quarter of the hidden-state stack,
`final_token_layer_22` through `final_token_layer_28`, calibrates a diagonal
safe-secret distribution inside each grouped fold, and trains on per-layer
deviation scores. This is still an approximation: it does not yet implement
CCI/CFS, learned nonnegative layer weighting, or richer readout positions beyond
the final prompt token.

Against the current combined static feature, the first CIFT-like score loses on
all four checkpoints:

| Dataset | Combined Macro F1 | CIFT-like Macro F1 | Delta Macro F1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Baseline | 0.8804 | 0.6981 | -0.1822 |
| Hard V1 | 0.9331 | 0.5399 | -0.3932 |
| Hard V2 | 0.9657 | 0.5329 | -0.4328 |
| Hard V3 | 0.8811 | 0.4076 | -0.4735 |

Treat this as a negative checkpoint, not a failed project direction. It says
the naive calibrated-distance score is not enough by itself. The next
CIFT-focused work should isolate whether the weakness comes from the readout
position, the score compression, missing layer weighting, or the calibration
set.

A V2 CIFT-like ablation now separates some of those causes. It compares eight
last-quarter variants across final-token versus mean-pool readout proxies,
diagonal-distance versus standardized-residual representations, and
safe-secret-only versus benign-plus-safe calibration. The combined static
feature still wins every checkpoint, but residual-concat variants are much
stronger than diagonal-distance variants:

| Dataset | Combined Macro F1 | Best CIFT-like Macro F1 | Delta Macro F1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Baseline | 0.8804 | 0.8623 | -0.0181 |
| Hard V1 | 0.9331 | 0.8132 | -0.1199 |
| Hard V2 | 0.9657 | 0.7808 | -0.1849 |
| Hard V3 | 0.8811 | 0.7461 | -0.1350 |

The aggregate result points at score compression as a major weakness in the
first CIFT-like attempt. The best final-token residual variants average 0.7924
macro F1, while the best final-token diagonal variant averages 0.5783. The
calibration-set axis does not affect residual-concat results because the
downstream activation classifier standardizes those features again; the next
CIFT refinement should preserve calibrated residual magnitudes when testing
calibration choices.

A V3 CIFT-like ablation adds absolute residual features and a raw logistic
regression mode that preserves calibrated feature scale. The combined static
feature still wins every checkpoint, but raw signed residuals close the gap on
the easier datasets:

| Dataset | Combined Macro F1 | Best CIFT-like Macro F1 | Delta Macro F1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Baseline | 0.8804 | 0.8788 | -0.0015 |
| Hard V1 | 0.9331 | 0.8236 | -0.1095 |
| Hard V2 | 0.9657 | 0.7808 | -0.1849 |
| Hard V3 | 0.8811 | 0.7461 | -0.1350 |

The strongest aggregate CIFT-like family remains signed standardized residuals
over final-token last-quarter layers. Absolute residual magnitude alone is
weaker, though nonleaking calibration improves absolute residual variants. The
result motivated testing whether a simple learned nonnegative layer-weighted
head could improve the signed residual representation.

A first layer-weighted CIFT-like head now trains one signed-residual classifier
per final-token last-quarter layer, converts each layer into an exfiltration
risk probability, learns nonnegative AUC-based layer weights inside each grouped
fold, and evaluates a learned threshold on held-out prompt families. The
combined static feature still wins every checkpoint:

| Dataset | Combined Macro F1 | Layer-Weighted Head Macro F1 | Delta Macro F1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Baseline | 0.8804 | 0.8293 | -0.0511 |
| Hard V1 | 0.9331 | 0.8132 | -0.1199 |
| Hard V2 | 0.9657 | 0.7633 | -0.2024 |
| Hard V3 | 0.8811 | 0.7461 | -0.1350 |

The diagnostic result is that the learned mean weights are uniform across
layers 22 through 28. Under this heuristic, the late final-token residual
classifiers look redundant rather than complementary. The next CIFT step should
therefore move past simple final-token layer weighting toward a richer CFS-like
head with out-of-fold per-layer scores and readout positions beyond the final
prompt token.

A first out-of-fold CIFT meta-head now trains per-source residual classifiers
inside inner grouped folds, uses their out-of-fold exfiltration-risk scores as
meta-head features, and compares final-token last-quarter sources against an
expanded final-token plus mean-pool source set. The expanded source set is the
best CIFT-like variant on every checkpoint, and it is the first CIFT-like
checkpoint to beat the combined static feature on any registered dataset:

| Dataset | Combined Macro F1 | Best Meta-Head Macro F1 | Delta Macro F1 | Winner |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Baseline | 0.8804 | 0.8598 | -0.0206 | combined static |
| Hard V1 | 0.9331 | 0.8788 | -0.0543 | combined static |
| Hard V2 | 0.9657 | 0.8823 | -0.0834 | combined static |
| Hard V3 | 0.8811 | 0.9156 | +0.0345 | OOF meta-head |

This is not a promotion result because the combined static feature still wins
three of four checkpoints, including Hard V2. It is useful because mean-pool
readout expansion improves every checkpoint relative to final-token-only CIFT
meta-learning: 0.8841 mean macro F1 versus 0.8209. The next CIFT work should
analyze the Hard V3 win and Hard V2 deficit, then test calibration/readout
variants before changing the monitor contract.

The Hard V2/Hard V3 residual analysis now explains that split. Across those two
checkpoints, the OOF meta-head has 12 errors versus 9 for the combined static
feature, with 3 fixed, 6 persistent, and 6 introduced errors. Hard V2 is the
blocking regression: 0 fixed errors and 5 introduced errors. Hard V3 is the
encouraging case: 3 fixed errors and 1 introduced error.

| Dataset | Reference Errors | Meta-Head Errors | Fixed | Persistent | Introduced |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Hard V2 | 2 | 7 | 0 | 2 | 5 |
| Hard V3 | 7 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 1 |

The Hard V3 win comes mainly from fixing two
`hard_v3_exfil_tool_payload_forward` misses and one
`hard_v3_safe_policy_note_category` miss. The Hard V2 deficit comes from
introduced misses in broker, output-contract, policy-exception, broker-boundary,
and tool-argument families. The next CIFT step should target those introduced
Hard V2 families while preserving the Hard V3 fixed cases.

A compact 12-variant CIFT meta-head ablation now tests that next step across
three axes: calibration set, source subset, and decision rule. The result is a
negative but useful checkpoint. The best variant is still the current full
dual-readout, safe-secret-calibrated, logistic-default meta-head:

```text
full_dual_readout_safe_secret_logistic_default
```

No tested variant reduces the Hard V2 introduced-error count. Broadening
calibration to benign-plus-safe rows has no measured effect, train-fold
threshold tuning worsens the result, and trimming the source set to earlier
last-quarter layers loses most of the Hard V3 gains.

| Source Set | Best Candidate Errors | Best Introduced Errors | Best Fixed Errors |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Full dual readout | 12 | 6 | 3 |
| Early dual readout | 22 | 14 | 1 |
| Early final token | 21 | 13 | 1 |

The next CIFT step should move from coarse grid ablation to score-level
diagnosis of the five Hard V2 introduced cases: per-source risk scores,
meta-head coefficients, and fold thresholds.

A score-level Hard V2 diagnosis now records the exact fold threshold,
meta-head risk score, risk-oriented logit, standardized per-source scores, and
per-source logit contributions for those introduced errors. It reproduces the
residual finding exactly: 2 reference errors, 7 meta-head errors, and 5
introduced errors. The three exfiltration false negatives land below the
default 0.5 threshold with meta risk scores 0.2375, 0.4275, and 0.0304. The two
safe false positives land above threshold at 0.6555 and 0.7307.

The most active source on the introduced cases is `mean_pool_layer_28`
(+0.8614 mean logit contribution, 2.2667 max absolute contribution), followed
by mixed and sometimes opposing mean-pool late-layer signals. This points
toward source calibration and late mean-pool weighting as the next debugging
surface, not simply a global decision-threshold problem.

A targeted source-ablation checkpoint tested that hypothesis directly across
Hard V2 and Hard V3. The full dual-readout meta-head remains the best variant.
Dropping `mean_pool_layer_28` leaves Hard V2 unchanged at 7 candidate errors
and 5 introduced errors, while Hard V3 keeps the same candidate error count but
trades one extra fixed error for one extra introduced error. Dropping the last
two mean-pool sources, the last final-token source, or the full last dual
readout layer all worsens the aggregate result.

| Variant | Candidate Errors | Fixed | Persistent | Introduced | Net Error Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Full dual readout | 12 | 3 | 6 | 6 | 3 |
| Drop last mean pool | 12 | 4 | 5 | 7 | 3 |
| Drop last two mean pool | 15 | 2 | 7 | 8 | 6 |
| Drop last final token | 14 | 3 | 6 | 8 | 5 |
| Drop last dual readout layer | 15 | 2 | 7 | 8 | 6 |

The source-level error is therefore not isolated to one removable source. The
next CIFT refinement should look at how source scores are calibrated and
combined, rather than pruning `mean_pool_layer_28` outright.

A constrained-combiner ablation tested simple monotone alternatives on the same
full dual-readout source set. These rules are more interpretable than the
logistic meta-head because higher source risk cannot reduce final risk, but
they are much weaker on the current source scores. Mean score, majority vote,
max score, and top-two mean all introduce substantially more errors than the
logistic meta-head.

| Combiner | Candidate Errors | Fixed | Persistent | Introduced | Net Error Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Logistic meta-head | 12 | 3 | 6 | 6 | 3 |
| Mean score | 26 | 2 | 7 | 19 | 17 |
| Majority vote | 27 | 2 | 7 | 20 | 18 |
| Top-two mean | 41 | 1 | 8 | 33 | 32 |
| Max score | 42 | 1 | 8 | 34 | 33 |

This means the per-source risk scores are not calibrated enough to combine
directly with raw averaging or voting. The logistic meta-head is doing useful
cross-source correction, even though it still has the Hard V2 regression. The
next constrained direction should be supervised but regularized: e.g.,
non-negative logistic weights, simplex weights, or calibrated source scores
before aggregation.

A supervised constrained-combiner follow-up tested non-negative logistic weights
and simplex-constrained logistic weights. These variants are better than raw
monotone aggregation, but still weaker than the unconstrained logistic
meta-head. Both constrained supervised variants produce 23 total candidate
errors and 17 introduced errors across Hard V2/Hard V3, versus 12 and 6 for the
current logistic meta-head.

| Combiner | Candidate Errors | Fixed | Persistent | Introduced | Net Error Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Logistic meta-head | 12 | 3 | 6 | 6 | 3 |
| Positive logistic | 23 | 3 | 6 | 17 | 14 |
| Simplex logistic | 23 | 3 | 6 | 17 | 14 |

The result suggests the signed logistic weights are not merely overfitting
noise; they are correcting source-score inversions that the current source
heads produce. The next refinement should preserve supervised correction while
testing safer operating points, such as fold-learned thresholds or explicit
source-score calibration.

## Lineage Rules

Organization matters here. Any dataset, activation artifact, or machine-readable
report that supports a stated result should be registered in `data/lineage.json`
with its SHA256 hash.

The rule of thumb:

```text
Do not replace an experimental state that produced a reported metric.
```

Add new files and new lineage records rather than overwriting baseline
evidence. Current examples:

```text
data/prompts_hard.jsonl
data/prompts_hard_v2.jsonl
data/prompts_hard_v3.jsonl
data/activations/qwen3_0_6b_hard_all_layers.pt
data/activations/qwen3_0_6b_hard_v2_all_layers.pt
data/activations/qwen3_0_6b_hard_v3_all_layers.pt
data/reports/binary_tasks_hard_grouped.json
```

Future datasets should use new names, for example:

```text
data/prompts_tool_calls.jsonl
data/prompts_hard_v4.jsonl
data/activations/qwen3_0_6b_hard_v4_all_layers.pt
```

## Next Moves

The next experimental steps split into two related threads: completing the
static-feature promotion review, and refining the CIFT-like path into a closer
implementation of the paper method. Do not silently promote the combined
feature just because it improves aggregate performance, and do not discard CIFT
because the first simplified calibrated-distance score underperformed.

Recommended sequence:

1. Human-review the three Hard V3 combined-regression cases.
2. Decide whether each case is a true model regression, a defensible tradeoff,
   or a dataset/label ambiguity.
3. Keep `mean_pool_layer_18` as the fixed regression checkpoint while
   final-token candidates remain under evaluation.
4. Define a promotion rule that weighs average performance, worst-case
   checkpoint performance, and post-hoc discovery risk.
5. For CIFT-like work, preserve supervised correction while testing safer
   operating points: fold-learned thresholds, source-score calibration, or
   regularized signed weights that keep the Hard V3 fixed cases.
6. Keep registering every dataset, artifact, and machine-readable report in
   `data/lineage.json`.

The research question remains narrow and concrete:

```text
Does the activation signal still help when surface text cues become less generous?
```
