"""Typed error hierarchy for DP-HONEY.

Every failure mode raises a subclass of :class:`DPHoneyError`. This lets the CLI
map a single base type to a clean nonzero exit while callers that care can still
distinguish specific conditions (bad privacy parameters vs. artifact drift vs.
schema corruption). We never raise bare ``Exception`` and never swallow errors
silently.
